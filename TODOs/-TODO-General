# Get better sense for how to organize css for site
# app.css for reusable classes regarding multiple files
# ____.razor.css for individual files
# Add dropdown for center home button
# Dropdown includes options for SVI, SVC and Comfort

- CURRENT STATE:
  - Trying to remove the navbutton on load of splash screen
  - Reintroduce navbutton onclick of one of the logos

- Splash page that asks for location they are looking for
  - This will probably just be main home page, rather than modal. This page:
    - Will not have navigation button or tab
    - Will not be scrollable
    - Will consist of header that says something sexy like, "Where ya headed, handsome?"
    - Will have 3 logos to choose from
    - Will not be able to be navigated to after this option besides searchbar I guess
  # Create a component that will act as the logo buttons. Maybe this can be used in the navbar too

- Understand how to load an image asset from local files rather than linking to squarespace asset

- Events Page:
  - Have a form to let people leave info
  - Have a few emails to leave on the bottom of the page
  - Maybe figure a dummy phone number

- Create reusable components for
  - Gallery
  - Events
  - Hours
  - Join the team
  - Menu
  - Menu Item
- Create admin page for editing, removing and adding cocktails
  - This will utilize EF Core
  - on click brings up dropdown menu for other locations
  - after initial location tag, provide option for dropdown nav menu for the side, this provides nav options for
    - Menu (default)
    - Gallery
    - Events
    - Hours
    - Join the team
  - Consider adding breakpoint for nav menu to become horizonal and permanent on large screen
  - Make a navigation button component to reuse with all pages and homes
