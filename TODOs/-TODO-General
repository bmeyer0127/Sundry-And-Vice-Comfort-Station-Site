# FINISHED #################################################################################################

  # Get better sense for how to organize css for site
# app.css for reusable classes regarding multiple files
# ____.razor.css for individual files
# Add dropdown for center home button
# Dropdown includes options for SVI, SVC and Comfort

# Make the nav button on main screen look less weird
  # Match color pallete
  # Add css breakpoints
  # Align nav button margin with rest of page
  # Figure out a good and clean way to allow sass to run scripts without always having bypass on current user
  #   Used RemoteSigned for CurrentUser
  # Remove border of accordion in offcanvas
  # Change color of accordion carrot
  # Currently have all of mf bootstrap in NavMenuOffCanvas.css
  #   Go through and import only what is needed
  # Fix sizing of offcanvas open button. This is a me thing. Im just bad at finding good sizes.

  # Trying to remove the navbutton on load of splash screen
  # Reintroduce navbutton when navigate to other home page
  # Cannot figure out how to pass the changed state of isSplash
  # State of hiding button happens in NavMenuOffCanvas
  # if isSplash is true, display of NavButton is none. If false, display is block
  # Try using NavigationManager.LocationChanged
  # Did not work. I think this is mostly for monitoring rather than making changes
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# Explaination: 
  # NavMenuOffCanvas.razor has parameter called isSplash. The parameter is given in MainLayout.razor
  #   where it is then evalutated in MainLayout.razor's @code section. This code takes the latter 
  #   character of the uri and if it is not '/' it returns false. This is because '/' indicates
  #   that it is the base for the URI

# Splash page that asks for location they are looking for
  # Create a component that will act as the logo buttons. Maybe this can be used in the navbar too
  # This will probably just be main home page, rather than modal. This page:
  #   Will not have navigation button or tab
  #   Will consist of header that says something sexy like, "Where ya headed, handsome?"
  #   Will have 3 logos to choose from
  #   Scrollbar will not be visible
  #   Will not be able to be navigated to after this option besides searchbar I guess
