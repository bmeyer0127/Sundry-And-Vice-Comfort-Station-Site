# Get better sense for how to organize css for site
# app.css for reusable classes regarding multiple files
# ____.razor.css for individual files
# Add dropdown for center home button
# Dropdown includes options for SVI, SVC and Comfort

  # Trying to remove the navbutton on load of splash screen
  # Reintroduce navbutton when navigate to other home page
  # Cannot figure out how to pass the changed state of isSplash
  # State of hiding button happens in NavMenuOffCanvas
    # if isSplash is true, display of NavButton is none. If false, display is block
  # Try using NavigationManager.LocationChanged
    # Did not work. I think this is mostly for monitoring rather than making changes
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# Explaination: 
  # NavMenuOffCanvas.razor has parameter called isSplash. The parameter is given in Home.razor
  #   where it is then evalutated in Home.razor's @code section. This code takes the latter 
  #   character of the uri and if it is not '/' it returns false. This is because '/' indicates
  #   that it is the ultimate home

  
- CURRENT STATE:

- Splash page that asks for location they are looking for
  - This will probably just be main home page, rather than modal. This page:
    - Will not have navigation button or tab
    - Will not be scrollable
    - Will consist of header that says something sexy like, "Where ya headed, handsome?"
    - Will have 3 logos to choose from
    - Will not be able to be navigated to after this option besides searchbar I guess
  # Create a component that will act as the logo buttons. Maybe this can be used in the navbar too


- Understand how to load an image asset from local files rather than linking to squarespace asset

- Events Page:
  - Have a form to let people leave info
  - Have a few emails to leave on the bottom of the page
  - Maybe figure a dummy phone number

- Create reusable components for
  - Gallery
  - Events

    - Menu (default)
    - Gallery
    - Events
