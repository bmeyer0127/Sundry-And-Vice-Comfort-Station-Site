# CURRENT TASK ###########################################################################################

- Really gotta go through all of this and comment on how it all works, man
- Also need to buckle down and just really fix up the stylings

--FUNCTIONALITY--

- Actually add ability to add menuItem from Admin page
    # Got to the point where it can submit successfully to the database
    # Still trying to figure out how to accept input
    # Beginning to think I have a fundamental misunderstanding about forms. Will study and learn
        # Began using EditForm component. It felt a lot more suited for the job bc it:
            # Can use model binding
            # Can supply parameters directly from the form upon submission
    # Figure out how to accept dropdown info for ItemType
        # Just needed some linq and value binding
        # ItemTypeDropdown is no longer being used
    # Need to add a price field
    # Need to be able to add to multiple tables at once
    # Checkbox input for locations
    # Checkbox input for allergies
    # Clear data input on submit
    # On submit the app works and give information to database
        # On second submit with the same data, an unhandled error occurs
        # This also happens on second sumbit no even if you change the inputs
        # I think I must create a model for the form itself and add model = new model()
            # Worked!
    # Toast popup after submitting a cocktail
        # Disappear after ~5 seconds
    # Whenever I hit enter to update the search in IngredientList it submits the cocktail.
        # I'll try to have it update on each keystroke
        # ^^^ Added this with @bind:event="oninput"
        # Still don't love the idea with it submitting with enter but I guess it's best for accessibility
    - Format better for both desktop and mobile (mobile first)
        - Consider wrapping AddCocktail in just a dropdown form
        - OffCanvas might actually be cuter
    - Add input validation for the following:
        - Price must be whole integer
        - ItemName is required
        - ItemTypeID is required


- IngredientsList functionality:
    # Currently adds ingredient to a separate list and gives it its own respective input for 
        measurement amount and measurement type.
    # Add functionality to save the data.
    # Measurement type dropdown currently has no functionality
        # Make the dropdown itself scrollable rather than 100% height.
        # Make each individual li a button to click on
    # Okay so it kinda works now. AddCocktail is currently a child of IngredientList, which allows the
        passing of the CascadingValue that is the list of added ingredient.
        I don't really love this setup because it kind of feels like a round about and messes
        with the layout of the page. I'll try to pass the value without cascading value
    # Maybe try using NavigationManager and URI routing
    # ^^^ Did not use this but I got it to work by using the following solution:
        # Add cocktail is now the component used in Admin
        # IngredientList now has a required parameter called ingredientMeasurement
            # which is a List<IngredientMeasurement> and is defined in AddCocktail
        # The class is specified in IngredientList but the required parameter is defined in AddCocktail
            # which is then fed into the IngredientList component in AddCocktail
    # Clear the ingredientList in AddCocktail after submition
    # Add ability to remove items from IngredientList
    # Make it impossible to add the same ingredient twice to the list


--STYLINGS--

- Wide screen actually may give room for too many columns at a time. Try to limit
    - Beef up the margins of the container with for large screen

- Filter option stylings:
    - Dropdown Menu:
        - Find a better color pallete. Something that accents the background and text color of main page
    - Button Group:
        - Honestly not bad

- Make Admin button look natural and pretty

# TODO #####################################################################################################

- Limit the amount of characters for the description so it fits on one line

- Woof definitely need to clean up NavMenuOffCanvas.scss
    - Still not completely happy with it but breakpoints for the button are fine for now
        - Def need to be more size appropriate



- Welcome Component
    - Display the same message with a unique styling depending on the current location
        - Unsure about the message
        - Styles:
            SVI:
                - Art deco. Think if Gatsby was a little more depressed and broody.
            SVC: 
                - Sexy apothocary. Classic and moody
            CS:
                - Under the stars kind of vibe. Dark blues, some whites
                - Consider navy and bright yellow

- Admin page: 
    - Allow user to reorganize item ingredients for how they are displayed

- Trying to populate a collection of Ingredients to a list if they are checked
- I am not looking to add anything to any database until the AddCocktail submit button is hit
- I just need to create a temorary array to hold the ingredient names (and maybe IDs)

- Admin functionality:
    - Add form
        - Creates a menu item from scratch. Will have:
            # Cocktail name form
            # Cocktail description form
            # Creator form
            # Boxes to check for which locations its at
            # Box for HasDairy
            # Box for HasEgg
            # Form for type of cocktail (draft, classic, unique)
                # Dropdown list to select the type. Types are:
                    # Draft, classic, house
            - Ingredients checklist. Specs of functionality will be as follows:
                # A scroll form will list all of the ingredients in the database
                # The container will also have a search function that filters with each letter typed
                # Each ingredient will have a checkbox next to it

                - Once checked, another container will be populated and will look like the following:
                    - To the left: a dropdown menu to select the amount necessary
                    - In the center: the name of the ingredient
                    - To the right: an X to remove the ingredient
                - Populate the container and then add the ingredient - menuitem combo on submit
    - Update/Delete form

- Create admin page for CRUD options for all of the tables
    # Just create a razor page and give no way to navigate to
    - Add password protection for admins.
        - Creates accounts manually rather than having a separate page for that.

- Look into server hosting for Circle Hospitality database

- Build dynamic components for Events, Gallery, Hours, JoinTeam and Home.
    - These components will have customization options but the components will more or less have the same info displayed, just cooresponds to location

# Understand how to load an image asset from local files rather than linking to squarespace asset
    # Use PostImage
- Download specific font styles to use

- Events Page:
  - Have a form to let people leave info
  - Have a few emails to leave on the bottom of the page
  - Maybe figure a dummy phone number

- Create reusable components for
  - Gallery
  - Events
  - Hours
  - Join the team
  - Menu
  - Menu Item
- Create admin page for editing, removing and adding cocktails
  - This will utilize EF Core
  - on click brings up dropdown menu for other locations
  - after initial location tag, provide option for dropdown nav menu for the side, this provides nav options for
    - Menu (default)
    - Gallery
    - Events
    - Hours
    - Join the team
  - Consider adding breakpoint for nav menu to become horizonal and permanent on large screen
  - Make a navigation button component to reuse with all pages and homes

# FINISHED #################################################################################################

# Add sorting buttons for all, beers, house cocktail, classic cocktails and draft cocktail
    # This will involve just creating a component that holds all the buttons
    # Add actual sorting functionality
    # On mobile breakpoint either put sort buttons on different rows or have an accordion dropdown

Menu format:
    - Create a cocktail component to acheive the following:
        # Display price off to the top right of the box 
        # Allign cocktail name, description and created by to the left
        # Display the creater with a "Created by: " preface on the bottom left
            # This is conditional depending on if the cocktail has a creator listed
        # Display in single line if on mobile. Display in rows of 3 if on size md up
            - progress:
                # Probably will not happen in MenuItemDisplay because it's grid system has it's own container for 
                    each individual menu item
                # Moved individual menu item width restrictor from Menu to MenuItemDisplay
                # Can maybe create a weird loop to create columns and rows
                # Really think I'm over thinking this. I might need to step back
            - Solution: 
                # Wrap switch case statement in a row

# Consider the pros and cons of making a component for ItemSortButton
    # Not exactly worth

# Create sass class to apply to all non home pages

# Fix side margins on non-splash screen pages

# Select Price from LocationMenu to display on respective menu items

# Pass locationID from respective homepage top ItemSorter to be able to get correct menu info

# Add wines to item types

# Add price column to LocationMenu table

# Menu Component
    # Menu items displayed are not differentiating based on location
    # Separate each menu item in its own container. 

# Populate each cooresponding location homepage with a greeting, and maybe a separate navbar
#   and the menu, with filtering options, below it.
# Filtering options: 
    # The menu will be laid out in full with corresponding headers for each section
    # Filtering options will remove everything that is not included. 
    # Filtering options will not be stackable, but rather replace the other optons

# Add beer to ItemType
    # Add a few beers to the seed file too. To test sorting

# Create a seeding file for the database. It's getting really annoying updating two databases at once

# Set up environment variables with for the SQL connection string using appsettings.Development.json (and make that ingored by git)

# Rework measurement table to just include description (oz, dash instead of 1oz, 3dash). 
# ItemIngredients table will have another column for amount.

# Put Home.razor on a grid system
# Center homebuttons to fit around the picture with breakpoints
# Instead of setting display: none to picture, try  keeping the size of the picture the exact same and just cropping it for breakpoints
# What I want for the background image:
    # It will span the entire width of the view
    # It will span the entire height of the view
    # It will not resize, but rather cut off or crop sides of the image that are not in view port
    # If I disable flex on main it kinda goes away but fucks up the positioning of everything on the page?

# Add Entity to project
#   Go through each table and make sure to add necessary table instances
#   Do greater research into best practices. Would love to just make the model of the DB once.
# Create the parent-child relationships between tables
# Remove Gallery, Hours, and LocationMenus from database
# Integrate LocationMenus into MenuItems (LocationID for each MenuItem, null if not being used)
#   I am creating the context of it all within a new "Data" folder but I will not build the context until I am sure of it
#   Basic classes are created. Waiting to create context
#   Table Column Attributes:
#     Location
#     LocationMenu
#     MenuItem
#     ItemType
#     ItemIngredient
#     Ingredient
#     Measurement
#     Gallery
#     HoursOpen

  # Get better sense for how to organize css for site
# app.css for reusable classes regarding multiple files
# ____.razor.css for individual files
# Add dropdown for center home button
# Dropdown includes options for SVI, SVC and Comfort

# Make the nav button on main screen look less weird
  # Match color pallete
  # Add css breakpoints
  # Align nav button margin with rest of page
  # Figure out a good and clean way to allow sass to run scripts without always having bypass on current user
  #   Used RemoteSigned for CurrentUser
  # Remove border of accordion in offcanvas
  # Change color of accordion carrot
  # Currently have all of mf bootstrap in NavMenuOffCanvas.css
  #   Go through and import only what is needed
  # Fix sizing of offcanvas open button. This is a me thing. Im just bad at finding good sizes.

  # Trying to remove the navbutton on load of splash screen
  # Reintroduce navbutton when navigate to other home page
  # Cannot figure out how to pass the changed state of isSplash
  # State of hiding button happens in NavMenuOffCanvas
  # if isSplash is true, display of NavButton is none. If false, display is block
  # Try using NavigationManager.LocationChanged
  # Did not work. I think this is mostly for monitoring rather than making changes
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# Explaination: 
  # NavMenuOffCanvas.razor has parameter called isSplash. The parameter is given in MainLayout.razor
  #   where it is then evalutated in MainLayout.razor's @code section. This code takes the latter 
  #   character of the uri and if it is not '/' it returns false. This is because '/' indicates
  #   that it is the base for the URI

# Splash page that asks for location they are looking for
  # Create a component that will act as the logo buttons. Maybe this can be used in the navbar too
  # This will probably just be main home page, rather than modal. This page:
  #   Will not have navigation button or tab
  #   Will consist of header that says something sexy like, "Where ya headed, handsome?"
  #   Will have 3 logos to choose from
  #   Scrollbar will not be visible
  #   Will not be able to be navigated to after this option besides searchbar I guess
