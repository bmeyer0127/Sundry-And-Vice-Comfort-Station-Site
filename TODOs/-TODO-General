# CURRENT TASK ###########################################################################################

- Build Admin Page:

- Admin functionality:
    - Add form
        - Creates a menu item from scratch. Will have:
            # Cocktail name form
            # Cocktail description form
            # Creator form
            # Boxes to check for which locations its at
            # Box for HasDairy
            # Box for HasEgg
            # Form for type of cocktail (draft, classic, unique)
                # Dropdown list to select the type. Types are:
                    # Draft, classic, house
            - Ingredients checklist. Specs of functionality will be as follows:
                - A scroll form will list all of the ingredients in the database
                - Each ingredient will have a checkbox next to it
                - Once checked, another container will be populated and will look like the following:
                    - To the left: a dropdown menu to select the amount necessary
                    - In the center: the name of the ingredient
                    - To the right: an X to remove the ingredient
                - The container will also have a search function that filters with each letter typed
    - Update/Delete form

- Create admin page for CRUD options for all of the tables
    # Just create a razor page and give no way to navigate to
    - Add password protection for admins.
        - Creates accounts manually rather than having a separate page for that.


# TODO #####################################################################################################

- Consider making changes to measurement table. Maybe make separate tables for amounts and measurement descriptions

- Add bootstrap grid to Home.razor

- Find a way to share database with laptop and desktop. Cannot keep database running at all times. 
    - Cloud server maybe?

- Look into server hosting for Circle Hospitality database

- Build dynamic components for Events, Gallery, Hours, JoinTeam and Home.
- These components will have customization options but the components will more or less have the same info displayed, just cooresponds to location

- Understand how to load an image asset from local files rather than linking to squarespace asset
- Download specific font styles to use

- Events Page:
  - Have a form to let people leave info
  - Have a few emails to leave on the bottom of the page
  - Maybe figure a dummy phone number

- Create reusable components for
  - Gallery
  - Events
  - Hours
  - Join the team
  - Menu
  - Menu Item
- Create admin page for editing, removing and adding cocktails
  - This will utilize EF Core
  - on click brings up dropdown menu for other locations
  - after initial location tag, provide option for dropdown nav menu for the side, this provides nav options for
    - Menu (default)
    - Gallery
    - Events
    - Hours
    - Join the team
  - Consider adding breakpoint for nav menu to become horizonal and permanent on large screen
  - Make a navigation button component to reuse with all pages and homes

# FINISHED #################################################################################################

# Add Entity to project
#   Go through each table and make sure to add necessary table instances
#   Do greater research into best practices. Would love to just make the model of the DB once.
# Create the parent-child relationships between tables
# Remove Gallery, Hours, and LocationMenus from database
# Integrate LocationMenus into MenuItems (LocationID for each MenuItem, null if not being used)
#   I am creating the context of it all within a new "Data" folder but I will not build the context until I am sure of it
#   Basic classes are created. Waiting to create context
#   Table Column Attributes:
#     Location
#     LocationMenu
#     MenuItem
#     ItemType
#     ItemIngredient
#     Ingredient
#     Measurement
#     Gallery
#     HoursOpen

  # Get better sense for how to organize css for site
# app.css for reusable classes regarding multiple files
# ____.razor.css for individual files
# Add dropdown for center home button
# Dropdown includes options for SVI, SVC and Comfort

# Make the nav button on main screen look less weird
  # Match color pallete
  # Add css breakpoints
  # Align nav button margin with rest of page
  # Figure out a good and clean way to allow sass to run scripts without always having bypass on current user
  #   Used RemoteSigned for CurrentUser
  # Remove border of accordion in offcanvas
  # Change color of accordion carrot
  # Currently have all of mf bootstrap in NavMenuOffCanvas.css
  #   Go through and import only what is needed
  # Fix sizing of offcanvas open button. This is a me thing. Im just bad at finding good sizes.

  # Trying to remove the navbutton on load of splash screen
  # Reintroduce navbutton when navigate to other home page
  # Cannot figure out how to pass the changed state of isSplash
  # State of hiding button happens in NavMenuOffCanvas
  # if isSplash is true, display of NavButton is none. If false, display is block
  # Try using NavigationManager.LocationChanged
  # Did not work. I think this is mostly for monitoring rather than making changes
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# Explaination: 
  # NavMenuOffCanvas.razor has parameter called isSplash. The parameter is given in MainLayout.razor
  #   where it is then evalutated in MainLayout.razor's @code section. This code takes the latter 
  #   character of the uri and if it is not '/' it returns false. This is because '/' indicates
  #   that it is the base for the URI

# Splash page that asks for location they are looking for
  # Create a component that will act as the logo buttons. Maybe this can be used in the navbar too
  # This will probably just be main home page, rather than modal. This page:
  #   Will not have navigation button or tab
  #   Will consist of header that says something sexy like, "Where ya headed, handsome?"
  #   Will have 3 logos to choose from
  #   Scrollbar will not be visible
  #   Will not be able to be navigated to after this option besides searchbar I guess
